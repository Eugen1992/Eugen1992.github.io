<br>
<p class="dropcap">Over the last few months our readers have been going crazy about this incredible new internet economy, originally from the USA, that is now helping Brits all over the country earning thousands a week without putting in much effort. </p>

<p>This ‘Legal Hack’ was discovered in the United States and helped hundreds of ordinary citizens earn between $5,000 and $10,000 a week while working from home. But when the government, banks and big corporations found out the ‘working class’ got rich too quickly they panicked and did everything within their powers to BAN this method from the country. </p>

<p>The USA banned it in 2017, but it’s still legal in the United Kingdom as of today.</p>

<!--
<p>Before we continue we have to warn you. The financial elite are deathly afraid more Brits are jumping on this. It’s already pissed off several very powerful banks. Big brokerage firms are out for blood because the’re loosing millions and  together with  the goverments they will do everything within their powers to BAN this method from the U.K. and prevent more ‘working-class’ citizens from getting rich overnight.  </p>
-->



<p>Surprisingly, 9 out of 10 Brits have never heard about this brilliant passive income system.

After extensive research and interviewing members of the system, we from NewsDaily were blown away by the results. </p>



<p>If you have more than £1000, a valid email address, and are not afraid to pick up the phone then the 5 minutes it takes to read this report might just change your life forever. <br />
<strong>Keep reading and you'll find out why.</strong></p>

<div class="results"> <img src="1.jpg" width="600">
<p class="bold"> Georgina Sanders and her new £250 000 Mercedes G wagon...  </p>
</div>

<p>This Single Stay-At-Home Mom was sick of living from paycheck to paycheck and started looking online for extra ways to make money online while being able to take care of her kids. We sat down with Sanders to find out how she managed to make so much cash in record time and how she’s planning to continue his luxurious lifestyle in the future.</p>


<p><strong>PPLMAGAZINE:</strong> Tell us about your financial situation? </p>
<p><i><strong>Sanders:</strong> Life seemed like it was merely a succession of bills, and worrying about how to pay the bills. About a year ago, my car broke down and I didn’t have the money to repair it. I still remember how I broke down in tears as I couldn't handle the stress anymore.  
<br />
At that moment I decided to take charge of my own finances and figure out a way to get me and my family out of this mess..</i></p>
 <p><i>After months of research falling into scam after scam my wealthy uncle from the USA showed me a brilliant system unlike anything I had ever seen before which can be used even if you do not have a lot of money. </p>
 
 <p>Within the first day of joining I had already made £974.53 profit. And in under 90 days I could pay-off my entire £215.000 mortgage in cash...”</i></p>
 
 
 

<p><strong>PPLMAGAZINE:</strong> So, what’s the secret?</p>
<p><i><strong>Sanders:</strong> “I'm not entirely sure. My rich uncle explained me it's a compounding technique borrowed from rich bankers. It sounds complicated but it's very simple and straightforward. I don't have a college degree and I'm not a computer genius, and I know nothing about the financial markets. But that didn't stop me from making tens of thousands of pounds... and this is just the start!"






</i></p>

<div class="results"> <img src="4.png" width="600">

<p class="bold">Sanders now enjoys the luxuries of his recently acquired wealth...</p>
</div>
<p>Sanders isn’t the only Brit who is seeing the positive effects. A source from a leading consultancy stated <i>“This is now creating many more weekly millionaires than the lottery. In fact, we are seeing 90% of new clients seeking wealth advice now earn their main income with it. What is astounding is that many of these people were working in regular jobs, like construction, office jobs and even unemployed and now they are earning more than top CEO's in London, New York or Tokyo.”</i></p>

<p>Both men and women over 30 have reported earnings of at least £4,428 on average every week. Even famous billionaires agreed this 'new economy' is a once in a lifetime opportunity 99% of the population is unaware of.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<div class="results"> <img src="richard-branson-warren.jpg" width="100%">

<p><strong></strong><i> “Imagine buying google.com when the internet first began. That same opportunity is occurring right now and it's 100 times more powerful. Literally anyone can begin taking advantage of this new economy. The key to success in life is preparation and timing. Sadly, this will really be the only opportunity in 100 years that the average person will have access building wealth and making money at home. Because the window for this is so narrow, many people will miss out on this. There really is just a few months or even weeks left to rake in mountains of cash."</i></p>





</div>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p>This new economy is called option signals. It was discovered by a group of Russian traders back in 2010. They kept it to themselves for years until somebody tried to make a quick buck, hacked it, swiped it, and sold it to Wall Street. They were making billions and billions of dollars until it leaked to the public and the common folk got their hands on it. </p>

<p>Big banks started freaking out when more and more citizens withdrew their money to double or even triple it with just a few mouse clicks, so they did everything in their power to convince the US government to ban this from the country.</p> 

<div class="offer-list">
<h3><strong><a href="##LINK##">Essentially it works like this:</a></strong></h3>
<div class="block-item">
<div class="list-item">

<ol class="rectangle-list">
<li>The user can pick any commodity or stock to trade with;</li>
<li>Automated algorithms predict if it goes up or down based on its accurate analysis;</li>
<li>The trader follows the prediction and earns up to 190% profit;</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<div id="bottom-bar" class="bottom-bar">
<div class="rows">
<img src="profits2.png" width="100%">
</div>
</div>
<br>
<br>


<p>Option signals has nothing to do with trading or gambling because the outcome is predicted. The system applies a specifically designed algorithm which monitors the market 24/7 and issues accurate predictions on the base of the performed analysis. Since it does almost everything instead of the trader, very little is left to chance. 

This results in a success rate ranging from 93% to 97%. This makes option signals one of the best solutions for generation passive income from home even if you have no experience at all. And the best thing is earnings are NOT subject to income tax in the UK.

<p>As excited as we were after getting so many positive stories and even hearing famous billionaires raving about this we wanted to see the results ourselves.</p>


<h2>Putting The System To The Test</h2>



<p>It wasn’t hard to find a volunteer. Our inbox flooded with requests and we finally picked Chris Ward as the lucky one. He is a 42 year old father and lives in Manchester together with his wife. As a mechanic he has always been able to pay the bills, but was never able to take his family on a well deserved exotic holiday. And without having any computer skills, degrees or knowledge about how the financial markets work he would be our perfect fit for the test. </p>

<div class="results testimonial" style="clear:both;">


<p class="bold week">Day 1:</p>
<p>“The first thing I did was creating an account at this 100% safe, secured and regulated  page. It took me about 2 minutes to enter my name, email, phone-number and password. </p>

<p>To activate the system I had to transfer £250 to my new online wallet. Since it's just a balance transfer it didn't cost me anything. I knew for a fact I could get my money back anytime. </p>

<p>I felt great excitement about starting to trade  after all the news about people earning huge money from that system. Then I received my free call. Could it really be that simple?”</p>

<p class="bold week">Day 2:</p>
<p>On day two, I woke up and rushed to work. I had slept in and was going to be late for my train. When I got to the office, I checked my emails and drank my coffee. Then, I remembered, I forgot to check my trade! It was already 10:45am, so it was almost 12 hours since I placed it. I logged into the site, feeling nervous and excited. Would my funds still be there? I felt a little anxious…</p>

<p>I opened the dashboard of the site. I thought at first I had made a mistake. Was this my account? I double checked the account name in the corner, yes it was mine. At that point, I almost spilled my coffee! I could see that my new balance at that time was £1,224.53. Incredible! In only 12 hours, while I was sleeping, the account made £976.47 profit from the £250 that I had funded. I’m glad I remembered to make a screenshot of it, so you can see below what I saw that morning. I wrote to my account personal mentor. Amazingly, he was not as surprised as I was. “This is normal” he said, “in fact, we often see people earning more than that in the first 12 hours”. I was impressed, this thing was really working. For the rest of the day, I could hardly concentrate on my job.</p>



<div class="results"> <img src="profits.jpg" height="342" width="100%">
<p class="bold">Chris's account balance after one day...</p>
</div>


<p class="bold week">Day 3:</p>
<p>“On day three of my trading, I was really getting into it. I could see that this wasn’t some sort of complicated system for fund managers and stockbrokers. This was easy and not only that, it was very clear how I was earning so much money. I finally understood why famous billionaires called this a new economy: 100 times more powerful than anything else I had ever imagined. Before I wen to sleep that night my wallet showed me an asthonishing £7,453.” </p>

<p class="bold week">Day 4:</p>
<p>“Today, things really took off. My mentor at Signal Options explained that the more money I made, the more I could potentially earn. I made a few more trades. The end of day balance was an astounding £18,785. This was much more than I earn in a year. In just 4 remarkable days, I had earned enough to travel the world with my girlfriend, first class! She didn’t even know about my success yet. I booked a table at a 5 star hotel for the weekend to tell her about this amazing story. I decided I would pay off her student debt so that she could continue to pursue her dream as a fashion buyer. This money was going to change our lives.”  </p>

<p class="bold week">Day 5:</p>
<p>“first thing I did was I checked my stats on my phone. I didn’t need to worry about rushing for the train, because I had already arranged for a limo to collect me that morning. Sure, the cost would be high, but I wanted to see the look on my boss’s face when I pulled up at our office in a sleek black stretch limo! I felt like Gordon Gecko in the movie “Wall St.” and it was so much fun. I decided that I didn’t want to spend every day working for minimum wage when I could earn so much working from home (if you could call it working!). I quit my job and gave a huge gift basket for all my friends in the office. Some people thought maybe I had won the lottery. I didn’t tell them about my secret. I wanted to wait and reveal it first to my girlfriend.”</p>

<p class="bold week">Day 6:</p>
<p>“This is the last day of my trading journal. It's a Sunday and our 'family day', so I'm not working. Luckily my balance keeps growing, even today. It doesn't matter if I spend time with my family or do something else, everyday the markets are open I'll be making profits. My total balance right now is £158.257 and it just keeps growing. </p>

<p>“I decided to withdraw £100.000 to my savings account. Within 5 minutes the bank manager called wondering how I could earn this kind of money. When I told him I got access to Option Signals he told me I wasn't the first one who made huge sums of cash using this and invited me to talk about investment opportunities.  </p>

<p> Barely three weeks ago I couldn't get a mortgage and now the bank invited me to a private business event. Incredible how fast times can change..”</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As a consumer, you may have your doubts about the effects of Options Signals, but you should give it a try; the results are real. The results from our users speak for itself. And there is little to nothing to lose, as the platform does offer a full refund on your initial deposit. </p>

<p>In these difficult economic times, everyones deserver an oppotuniy to earn extra cash, unfortunately programs like these are only available for a selected group</p>

<h2>How Can I Join?</h2>

<p>For a limited time, we convinced the owners to open 100 more positions before they will go underground forever.</p>

<p>But we have to warn you, the UK government and big corporations are already taking note and are doing everything within their power to take this system down and delete access from the internet forever.</p>
