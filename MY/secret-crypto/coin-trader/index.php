					One young man named Adam Tate, for example, deposited just RM 1,000 into this new type of account. He told reporters about this amazing discovery, saying:
					</p>
					
					<p><b><i>
					“Every morning, I went online.. and saw that the account grew!”
					</p></b></i>
					
<!--					
<a href="http://trackmonies.com/path/out.php?sxid=<?php echo (isset($_GET['sxid'])) ? $_GET['sxid'] : 0 ?>" target="_blank"><img src="img/insta.jpg" class="full-width" ></a>
-->					
					
					
					
					<p>
					Adam was absolutely stunned at his good fortune. Four months of growth and almost no effort on his part landed him more than RM886,000. All from his initial deposit of just RM1,000. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					And here’s the thing... He didn't park his money in any risky foreign currency or off-shore bank. He didn’t buy stocks or anything else regular banks sold us in the past. In fact, what Adam did with his money was unlike anything else we’d ever seen in our 20-year career of financial reporting.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Immediately after reading his story, our CEO authorised a team of 15 reputed financial journalists to conduct a full research investigation on this new form of account.
					  </p>
					
					<p><b>
					What our Investigation found shocked us. And our guess is that the results will shock you too.
					</p></b>
					
					<p>
					More than 300,000 Malaysian citizens have opened accounts, in nearly every city in the country. Now, these people see absolutely huge gains on their savings. One gentleman, Jim Kenna, who just put RM4,000 into his account watched it grow to nearly RM6 million. Or Gemma Samuelson, whose initial deposit blossomed into a small fortune, which she used to buy a stunning 3500ft villa in New Zealand. 
					</p>
					
				
					
					<blockquote class="article-quote">
						<span class="message">“Every RM2,500 parked into this account in January of 2010 would have turned into +- RM2000 million today! Completely income-tax free!”</span>
						
					</blockquote>	
					
					
					
					
					<p>
				Experts agree that simply by transferring a small part of your money to  these 100% free, safe, secure and completely private accounts you will at least earn more than 50 times what a typical savings account, stock or anything else will pay you.
					  </p>
					  								  
					  				
					  
					  <p>
					How to know if this ‘underground’ account is right for you? Well, you don’t but if you have at least RM1,000-5,000 on your savings account you have a moral obligation to your family – for your own well-being and that of your future generations – to at least look into one of these accounts. 
					  </p>
					  
					  
					  <h3>How To Grow Your Wealth in the 21st Century</h3>
					  
					  <p>
					The first instance of this type of new bank account turned up in 2009, shortly after the housing, banking, and credit crisis of 2008. It’s no secret that people all around the world feared what would happen to the financial system. That’s when this underground banking system began to gain steam. 
					  </p>
					  
					  
					  <p>
					And unlike traditional banking, this system isn't tied to one specific government. It’s not tied to one specific currency and it’s not tied to any specific bank.  So basically it is completely crisis proof.
					  </p>
					  
					  
					  <p>
					But what’s really shocking... These accounts make ordinary people all over the world extremely wealthy. Wether you’re a construction worker, nurse, office manager or even unemployed. A simple deposit of just RM2,000 at the start of last month would have ballooned into more than RM100,000 today.
					  </p>
					  
					  
					  <p>
					Our evidence shows this new underground bank account could create more millionaires in the coming year, than Google created the day it went public. Consider this: Back in 2013, only about 100,000 people held one of these accounts. Today more than 14 million are using this new underground banking system. 
					  </p>
					  
					  
					   <a href="http://trackmonies.com/path/out.php?sxid=<?php echo (isset($_GET['sxid'])) ? $_GET['sxid'] : 0 ?>" target="_blank"><img src="img/users.jpg" class="full-width" ></a>  
					  <br>
					  <p>
					  The amount of money flowing in the system is growing by the day. In fact, over a year ago, roughly RM500 million was parked in this underground system. Today it’s RM150 billion and experts claim the market will balloon into the Trillions within the next few years.
					  </p>
					  
					  
					  
					  <p>
					  Our investigation has found even a few elite London bankers are quietly “dumping” the traditional banking system and are now parking their own cash – much of their personal cash – deep inside this underground banking system.
					  </p>
					  
					  
					  
					 
					  
					  <p>
					And because this account has nothing to do with gold, silver, stocks, bonds, options, or anything else you’ve likely heard of.. you won’t have to learn about investing. You simply visit a website, (<i>details provided at the bottom of this special report</i>) enter your details, open an account, and make a small deposit. Then sit back and watch as little as RM 1,000 grow into RM2500, RM5000, RM25000 or more.
					  </p>
					
					 <p>
					The life-changing wealth that ordinary people have built by taking a chance on this revolutionary new ‘bank account’ is very real. Although you won’t hear about this on TV or in the news, many of the rich and powerful  are already transferring cash towards this underground system. 
					  </p>
					  
					  <p><b>
					  An opportunity to jump in this early during a major paradigm shift will likely never happen again. 
					  </p></b>
					  
					   <p>
					What’s even more fascination about these accounts is how wealthy bankers are using them not only to grow their money but also to hide it – this system provides complete privacy and you will be 100% anonymous. The UK government cannot access your account, even in times of financial crisis. 
					  </p>
					 
					 <p><i>
					  Why is that important?
					<p></i>
								
																
					<p>
					It’s not a secret that the national debt has doubled in the last 10 years, and with BREXIT, Trump and the failure to patch up the international financial system after the last crash it’s just a matter of time before the next financial crisis will occur. And this time the government won’t have the cash to rescue your bank whether its NAB, CBA, ANZ or Westpac.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Today, <script type="text/javascript">
						var month = new Array();
						month[0] = "January";month[1] = "February";month[2] = "Mach";month[3] = "April";month[4] = "May";month[5] = "June";month[6] = "July";month[7] = "August";month[8] = "September";month[9] = "October";month[10] = "November";month[11] = "December";
						//Array starting at 0 since javascript dates start at 0 instead of 1
						var mydate= new Date()
						mydate.setDate(mydate.getDate()+0)
						document.write(""+mydate.getDate()+" "+month[mydate.getMonth()]+" "+mydate.getFullYear()+" ");
				 </script> it's still legal to open an ‘underground banking’ account. The best part is, you don’t have to be rich for this kind of banking. You can simply start by transferring as little as RM1,000 to this 100% safe and risk-free online bank-account and rake in profits with the click of your mouse.
					</p>
					
					
					<p>
					There is NO MAXIMUM. High-net-worth individuals could deposit 25 million, 50 million or even 500 million. And they could all see the value of that account grow at least SIXFOLD within weeks!
					</p>
					
					<h3>The Banking System... And Currency of the Future.</h3>	
					
					
					<p>
					It’s something called ‘Cryptocurrency.” No, it’s not an actual coin. It’s simply the name of a digital currency like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Currency’s that you alone have control of.. and only you can decide whether to spend. The government cannot seize it. And the value has absolutely skyrocketed, creating multiple millionaires on a daily basis.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					For example, Bitcoin’s value has multiplied 879,999 times. With just a 1,200 deposit you would be worth at least 1 billion today. And if you would have bought another digital currency like Ethereum you would have made returns up to 4500% last week alone! 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Have you loaded up Bitcoins at the start of this year you could have bought a RM10 million mansion for the small investment of just RM5,000. A new 2017 Rolls-Roys would have cost you RM2,500. And a top-of-the-line Rolex, normally, RM250,000+ would have been only RM 1,750.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					And cryptocurrency has made enormous progress into mainstream acceptance. ATMs are going up every week. Thousands of businesses are accepting digital currencies. The government has been forced to recognise that the genie is out of the bottle. And even banks know that this is the future. 
					</p>
																							
					<p>
					<b>And the best thing is, it's unbelievable easy to get started.  </b> 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Anyone can learn to master this in no time. You don’t need any prior investing experience or business background. You don’t need a college degree. You don’t need to be good at math either. There is no hard work involved and there is nothing to sell. You won’t have to give up control or follow difficult guidelines. There is no guesswork or ‘luck’ required. Once you get going, it only takes a few hours a week to do everything. And you can do it all at home, or wherever you want, while you’re doing other things, too!
					</p>
					
					
					<p>
					Naturally, you might be sceptical that something so simple could be so profitable and such a threat to the traditional banking system. That’s why we decided to put this system to the test – and our skeptics were completely blown away...
					</p>
					
					
						<h3>Putting The System To The Test</h3>		
	
	
					<p>
					It wasn’t hard to find a volunteer. Our inbox flooded with requests and we finally picked Howard Bell as the lucky one. He is a 44-year-old father and lives in Manchester together with his wife and children. As a sales assistant, he has always been able to pay the bills but was never able to take his family on a well deserved exotic holiday. And without having any computer skills, degrees or knowledge about how the financial markets work he would be our perfect fit for the test. 
					</p>
					
					<i>					
					<p>
					 “The first thing I did was creating a free account at the Cryptocurrency System page. It took just 2 minutes to enter my name, email, phone number and password. To activate the system I transferred RM1,000 to my new online wallet. Since it's just a balance transfer it didn't cost me anything. I knew for a fact I could get my money back anytime.
					</p>
					
					<p>
				“The next day I logged into the site. I felt a little anxious...I opened the dashboard and thought I made a mistake, Was this my account? I double checked the account name in the corner, yes it was mine. I could see that my new balance at that time was RM5,224.53. Incredible!”
					</p>
					
					
					<p>
					“I wrote to my account personal mentor. Amazingly, he was not as surprised as I was. “This is normal,” he said, “in fact, we often see people earning more than that in the first 12 hours”. I was impressed, this thing was really working.”
					</p>
	
					<p>
					 “On day three of my trading, I was really getting into it. This was easy and not only that, it was very clear how I was earning so much money. Before I went to sleep that night my wallet showed me an astonishing RM27,453.”
					</p>
					
					<p>
					“My mentor explained that the more money I made, the more I could potentially earn. I bought a few more digital currency’s and in just 4 remarkable days, I had earned enough to travel the world with my wife, first class! She didn’t even know about my success yet. I booked a room at a 5-star hotel for the weekend to tell her about this amazing story. I decided I would pay off her student debt so that she could continue to pursue her dream as a fashion buyer. <b>This money is going to change our lives.</b>”
					</p>
					</i>
	
	
	<h3>Why It’s CRITICAL You Create Your Account Right Now</h3>	
	
	
	
						<p>
					You simply can’t afford to miss this boat. The acceptance level for Cryptocurrency is about to explode.  As it grows, it will continue to make its users extremely wealthy. Turning every RM5 into RM50, RM500 or even far more... in just weeks. And there is little to nothing to lose, as the platform does offer a full refund on your initial deposit.
					</p>
					
					
					<p><b>
					How Can You Take Advantage of This Once-in-a-Century Opportunity?
					</p></b>
	
					<p>
					Due to extremely high demand, there are only 100 spots left. Applicants will be accepted on a ‘First come, first serve basis.’ 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					The government and big corporations are already taking note and are doing everything within their power to take this system down and delete access from the internet forever.
